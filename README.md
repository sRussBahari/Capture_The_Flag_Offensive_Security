Date: Jul 2023

## Overview of the Offensive Security Project
Participated in a rigorous Capture the Flag (CTF) exercise of a fictive company Rekall Corporation (totalrekall.xyz), utilizing advanced offensive security techniques to uncover and exploit vulnerabilities within a simulated organization environment

## Key Achievements
- Detected and acted upon security flaws in the organization's web application, securing competition flags as proof of successful penetration
- Demonstrated proficiency in endpoint security by launching a targeted attack on Rekall's Linux servers, tapping into Linux-specific vulnerabilities to access critical data and capture competition flags
- Pivoted strategies to target Rekallâ€™s Windows servers, employing in-depth knowledge of Windows OS vulnerabilities to infiltrate the system and seize additional flags

## Technologies used
-Kali Linux
-Nessus
-Windows Operating System
-Linux Operating System
